The Journal features articles useful for practitioners and theorists alike.

The terms ""education"" and ""computing"" are viewed broadly. “Education” refers to the use of computer-based technologies at all levels of the formal education system, business and industry, home-schooling, lifelong learning, and unintentional learning environments. “Computing” refers to all forms of computer applications and innovations - both hardware and software. For example, this could range from mobile and ubiquitous computing to immersive 3D simulations and games to computing-enhanced virtual learning environments."

This journal explores the ways that different disciplines and alternative approaches can shed light on the study of technically mediated education. Working at the intersection of theoretical psychology, sociology, history, politics and philosophy it poses new questions and offers new answers for research and practice related to digital technologies in education. The change of the title of the journal in 2010 from E-Learning to E-Learning and Digital Media is expressive of this new and emphatically interdisciplinary orientation, and also reflects the fact that technologically-mediated education needs to be located within the political economy and informational ecology of changing mediatic forms."

Rigorous studies of theoretical, conceptual, or methodological issues pertaining to research application are also welcome.

Journal of Applied Gerontology is also highlighting submissions in three areas that will advance the state-of-the-art in applied gerontological/geriatric research:

studies that employ mixed methodologies (i.e., the integration of qualitative and quantitative data);
efforts that translate evidence-based research to clinical practice; and
policy evaluations that apply evaluation principles and methods to examine the implementation and effectiveness of a government or institutional policy or program."

IEEE Access will publish articles that are of high interest to readers, original, technically correct, and clearly presented. Supported by author publication charges (APC), its hallmarks are a rapid peer review and publication process with open access to all readers. Unlike IEEE's traditional Transactions or Journals, reviews are ""binary"", in that reviewers will either Accept or Reject an article in the form it is submitted in order to achieve rapid turnaround. Especially encouraged are submissions on:

Multidisciplinary topics, or applications-oriented articles and negative results that do not fit within the scope of IEEE's traditional journals.
Practical articles discussing new experiments or measurement techniques, interesting solutions to engineering.
Development of new or improved fabrication or manufacturing techniques.
Reviews or survey articles of new or evolving fields oriented to assist others in understanding the new area."

This is a peer-reviewed international journal with a vision to provide the academic and industrial community a platform for presenting original research ideas and applications. IJCA welcomes four special types of papers in addition to the regular research papers within its scope:

(a) Papers for which all results could be easily reproducible. For such papers, the authors will be asked to upload ""instructions for reproduction'', possibly with the source codes or stable URLs (from where the codes could be downloaded).

(b) Papers with negative results. For such papers, the experimental setting and negative results must be presented in detail. Also, why the negative results are important for the research community must be explained clearly. The rationale behind this kind of paper is that this would help researchers choose the correct approaches to solve problems and avoid the (already worked out) failed approaches.

(c) Detailed report, case study and literature review articles about innovative software / hardware, new technology, high impact computer applications and future development with sufficient background and subject coverage.

(d) Special issue papers focussing on a particular theme with significant importance or papers selected from a relevant conference with sufficient improvement and new material to differentiate from the papers published in a conference proceedings."

TGPPP welcomes submissions from established and early career researchers, practitioners and policy makers to contribute, manage and share knowledge and experience, and to learn from each other’s research through front-line thinking about government and the complex multi-scalar environment in which it evolves.

TGPPP encourages multi- and interdisciplinary approaches to issues, processes and developments that directly and indirectly influence government’s nature and power of government and the way in which it operates. Contributions exploring community, city, domestic, regional, international and global perspectives to these issues are welcome."

It publishes original contributions on the development of new computerized methodologies for solving industrial engineering problems, as well as the applications of those methodologies to problems of interest in the broad industrial engineering and associated communities. The journal encourages submissions that expand the frontiers of the fundamental theories and concepts underlying industrial engineering techniques.

CAIE also serves as a venue for articles evaluating the state-of-the-art of computer applications in various industrial engineering and related topics, and research in the utilization of computers in industrial engineering education. Papers reporting on applications of industrial engineering techniques to real life problems are welcome, as long as they satisfy the criteria of originality in the choice of the problem and the tools utilized to solve it, generality of the approach for applicability to other problems, and significance of the results produced.

A major aim of the journal is to foster international exchange of ideas and experiences among scholars and practitioners with shared interests all over the world."

The principal aim of the journal is to promote original systems ideas (concepts, principles, methods, theoretical or experimental results, etc.) that are broadly applicable to various kinds of systems. The term “general system” in the name of the journal is intended to indicate this aim–the orientation to systems ideas that have a general applicability. Typical subject areas covered by the journal include: uncertainty and randomness; fuzziness and imprecision; information; complexity; inductive and deductive reasoning about systems; learning; systems analysis and design; and theoretical as well as experimental knowledge regarding various categories of systems. Submitted research must be well presented and must clearly state the contribution and novelty. Manuscripts dealing with particular kinds of systems which lack general applicability across a broad range of systems should be sent to journals specializing in the respective topics."

aning2022,International Journal of Computers and Applications,Journal,Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design,United Kingdom,1997-2025,Not found,"The International Journal of Computers and Applications (IJCA) is a unique platform for publishing novel ideas, research outcomes and fundamental advances in all aspects of Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Computer Applications. This is a peer-reviewed international journal with a vision to provide the academic and industrial community a platform for presenting original research ideas and applications. IJCA welcomes four special types of papers in addition to the regular research papers within its scope:

(a) Papers for which all results could be easily reproducible. For such papers, the authors will be asked to upload ""instructions for reproduction'', possibly with the source codes or stable URLs (from where the codes could be downloaded).

(b) Papers with negative results. For such papers, the experimental setting and negative results must be presented in detail. Also, why the negative results are important for the research community must be explained clearly. The rationale behind this kind of paper is that this would help researchers choose the correct approaches to solve problems and avoid the (already worked out) failed approaches.

(c) Detailed report, case study and literature review articles about innovative software / hardware, new technology, high impact computer applications and future development with sufficient background and subject coverage.

(d) Special issue papers focussing on a particular theme with significant importance or papers selected from a relevant conference with sufficient improvement and new material to differentiate from the papers published in a conference proceedings."
